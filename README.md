# 🐍 Snake Game

A classic Snake game built using Python's `turtle` graphics library. This project is structured using object-oriented programming, with separate classes managing the snake, the food, and the scoreboard, and a main file that handles the overall game logic.

## 🧠 Object-Oriented Design

This game was built using a clean OOP approach:
- Snake: Handles the creation and movement of the snake, as well as adding new segments.
- Food: Randomly generates food items on the screen.
- Scoreboard: Displays the current score and "Game Over" message.
- main.py: Initializes the game window, listens for user input, and runs the game loop.
